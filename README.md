#NLP Group Project - A comparative Approach to Training a Question Answering Model using Transformers

This is a Natural Language Processing report that was written during my studies in UCL MSc Business Analytics. The goal was to create a Q&A model for UCL School of Management to timely answer the questions from potential students. 

The proposal and Final report is in the "Final_Proposal+Report", and all other files are the databases, webscrapper, and Q&A model built.
